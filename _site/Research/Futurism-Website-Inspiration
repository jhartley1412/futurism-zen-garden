Futurism CSS Design Website Inspiration

	This site, although very clean, uses good use of color in background and text, as well as incorporates clickable elements into the background (although on this particular site, that makes it a little difficult to transverse through it)

	Although very geometric (not very futuristic), this site very clearly incorporates it's environment and background into its UI. The lines between back and foreground are blurred to an extent and the piece as a whole works better than it's individual parts

	I like the Hermitage's websites's color scheme. I think it has a very Futuristic feel to it (darker greens, oranges, and blues). It also adds texture to it's links (Visit Us, Explore, etc). The textures are subtle, and add to the overall piece that is the website. The textures also remind me of an old Italian canvas, which can also speak Renaissance/Baroque/Rococo (woo!), but I argue that since it's on a website it's Futuristic, and using modern technology to blend the us, the user, to our environment/experience of using the site.

	The animations that just happen naturally (the desktop, light bulb, etc). I’d like to use something in the background, not necessarily “important” to have some movement and animation to it on my site.

	Again, another animation heavy site, I love how the grey circle follows you as you scroll down the page. I also like how the top of the page (“You have millions of things on your mind”) is surrounded by daily life chores and recreations, giving the user a sense of familiarity. The Futuristic aspect comes form the user almost becoming part of the website via the grey circle, and being lead down this site of information and fun icons that move and animate, blending the lines between the user and the website.
